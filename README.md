##  What is DecentFolio
- Decentralized Investment Portfolio!!
- Through smart contracts, one can achieve investment portfolios similar to ETFs/funds, allowing users to purchase multiple ERC20 Tokens at once in proportions, providing on-chain investment targets with lower risk compared to individual tokens.
- Implemented using ERC-721, when users invest, they receive a new NFT representing ownership that can be freely transferred.
- In addition to investments, users can freely create new DecentFolio investment portfolios.
- DecentFolio offers FlashLoan functionality to earn interest. When users redeem, they can profit not only from the difference in investment targets but also from the interest earned.
- DecentFolio operates on a governance model, managing in a decentralized manner.
